On implementing devise authentication with username:

https://github.com/plataformatec/devise/wiki/How-To:-Allow-users-to-sign-in-with-something-other-than-their-email-address
https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/plataformatec-devise/Fr2TgDQcYmA

Note that if you aren’t using e-mail as your authentication key, then it may be the case that users can have multiple accounts with the same e-mail address. This will cause the “recoverable” module not to work well, as it will only include a link in the password reset e-mail to the first account for which it finds a matching e-mail. Here is a thread on the Google Group about how to implement adding all the accounts information into the password reset email.


Final Countdown:

Add SSN to Tenant
Add SSN to Staff
Create an Apartment Type Model and Controller
  rails g model ApartmentType name:string code:string initial_deposit:decimal monthly_rent:decimal

  tie it to apartments

add amount and note to rental invoice
